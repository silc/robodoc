    If you use the SOURCE item and use a language
    that has multiline comments, such as C's  
        /* this is a comment
            on two lines */
    you will have to add a 
       remark begin markers:
    and 
       remark end markers:
    to your robodoc.rc file.

    ROBODoc has the following ones built-in

    There are many changes compared to V3.2.4:
    (1) You no longer need a makefile since robodoc
        can scan a whole directory tree for you.
        To generate documentation try 
        ./robodoc -src ./YourSourceDir --dest ./ADocDir --mulitdoc --html
    (2) The ROBODoc defaults file has been changed.  It is now
        called robodoc.rc and has a different format.
        Please see the manual in Docs/ for more information.
