  <para>The easiest way to install ROBODoc is to use one of the
    packages.  There are package for RedHat, Debian, OSX, and a precompiled
    executable for Windows.</para>
  <para>You can also compile --- from the sources.  On a system
    with <command>autoconfig</command> it is as simple as:</para>
  <programlisting>
./configure
make
make install
</programlisting>
  <para>This currently does not work with cygwin.</para>
  <para>Under Windows you can use one of the makefile. There is a makefile for Borland C, MINGW,
       and Cygwin.  For other compilers you might want to try  <filename>makefile.plain</filename>.
</para>
  <para>For instance for cygwin goto <filename>Source</filename> and run:</para>
  <programlisting>
make -f makefile.mingw-cygwin
</programlisting>
  <para>To install <command>ROBODoc</command> put the generated executable somewhere in your path.</para>
  <para>You can test your executable, by going to the
       <filename>Examples/PerlExample</filename> directory in the
       archive, and running <command>robodoc</command>.
       This should create a directory
       called <filename>Doc</filename>.  In there you should now
       find a file called <filename>masterindex.html</filename>.
